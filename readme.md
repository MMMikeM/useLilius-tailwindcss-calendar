# Mike's calendar example

Someone recently asked me about options available for date pickers that use tailwindcss utility classes, that's easily usable in React. I did some research and found there weren't any good examples, so I whipped one up myself (which I'll probably use sometime in the future).

Huge thanks to [It's Danny](https://github.com/its-danny), without his [useLilius hook](https://github.com/its-danny/use-lilius), this would have been far more difficult than it was.
